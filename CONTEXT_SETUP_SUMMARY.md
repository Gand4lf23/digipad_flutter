## 🎯 How to Use This Context

### Scenario 1: Opening Project in IDE (Fresh Start)

1. **Read:** Start with `QUICK_REFERENCE.md` (5 minutes)
   - Get oriented, understand the bug

2. **Reference:** Keep `CLAUDE.md` open
   - Full context while coding
   - Search for specific module descriptions

3. **Deep Dive:** Open `docs/MEASUREMENTS_BUG_ANALYSIS.md`
   - When you need technical details

**Result:** Agents can work with full context immediately

---

### Scenario 2: Implementing the Fix

1. **Open:** `docs/MEASUREMENTS_BUG_ANALYSIS.md`
   - See the exact formula change (lines 67-68)
   - Understand why it was wrong

2. **Code:** Modify `lib/screens/native_impl/native_split_screen.dart`
   ```dart
   // Line 67 - OLD:
   final newPitch = atan2(-x, sqrt(y * y + z * z)) * (180 / pi);
   
   // Line 67 - NEW:
   final newPitch = atan2(-y, sqrt(x * x + z * z)) * (180 / pi);
   ```

3. **Test:** Follow `docs/TESTING_GUIDE.md`
   - Phase 1: Angle validation (10 minutes)
   - Phase 2: Photo capture (5 minutes)
   - Phase 3: Edge cases (5 minutes)

**Result:** Agents can fix the bug autonomously with confidence

---

### Scenario 3: Onboarding New Team Member

1. **Send:** Link to `QUICK_REFERENCE.md`
   - 5-minute orientation

2. **Send:** Link to `CLAUDE.md`
   - Full project context

3. **Send:** Memory index (if using agents)
   - Persistent context loaded automatically

**Result:** New members productive immediately

---

## 🧠 Memory System Integration

The memory files are **automatically injected** into future Claude Code sessions:

### How It Works
1. **First session** (this one) → Memory files are created
2. **Subsequent sessions** → Memory index is auto-loaded
3. **Agents see context immediately** → No need to re-explain

### What Agents Will Know
- ✅ Project is DigiPad (Flutter optical measurement app)
- ✅ Core bug is pantoscopic angle calculation
- ✅ Bug is in `native_split_screen.dart` lines 67-68
- ✅ Architecture patterns (BLoC, MethodChannel, etc.)
- ✅ How to test the fix

### You Don't Need to Say
- "It's a Flutter app"
- "The angle formula is wrong"
- "The files are in lib/screens/native_impl/"
- Agents will know these automatically

---

## 🚀 To Get Started With Agents Now

### Option 1: Fix the Bug (Recommended)
Use the Explore or general-purpose agent and ask:
```
I have a Flutter optical measurement app. Review the pantoscopic angle 
calculation in lib/screens/native_impl/native_split_screen.dart and fix 
the bug where it's using the X-axis instead of the Y-axis. Test the fix 
following the steps in docs/TESTING_GUIDE.md.
```

**Agent will:**
1. Read CLAUDE.md (auto-loaded context)
2. Understand the architecture from memory
3. Fix the formula
4. Run tests per protocol

### Option 2: Explore the Full Project
```
Analyze the full DigiPad project structure and create a summary of 
the camera + optical measurement pipeline.
```

**Agent will:**
1. Have CLAUDE.md as reference
2. Use memory files for context
3. Understand the data flow
4. Can answer architecture questions

### Option 3: Just Ask Anything
```
How do I test the pantoscopic angle fix on an Android device?
```

**Agent will:**
1. Know context from memory
2. Reference docs/TESTING_GUIDE.md
3. Give you step-by-step instructions

## 🎓 Learning Path for Agents

When a new agent starts, it will automatically follow this path:

1. **Load Memory Index** (automatic)
   - See: "This is DigiPad, a Flutter optical measurement app"
   - See: "There's a pantoscopic angle bug in native_split_screen.dart"

2. **Reference CLAUDE.md** (when confused)
   - "What's the architecture?"
   - "Where are the screens?"
   - "How does camera integration work?"

3. **Deep Dive MEASUREMENTS_BUG_ANALYSIS.md** (when implementing)
   - "What's the correct formula?"
   - "Why was it wrong?"
   - "What are accelerometer axes?"

4. **Follow docs/TESTING_GUIDE.md** (when verifying)
   - "Phase 1: Device vertical should show 0°"
   - "Phase 2: Tilted forward should show +15°"
   - "Phase 3: Rapid changes should be smooth"

## 🔄 How to Update Context

If you discover new information or change requirements:

1. **Quick fixes:** Update relevant `.md` files in `docs/`
2. **Architecture changes:** Update `CLAUDE.md`
3. **New bugs found:** Create new memory file in `.claude/projects/Q--REPO-digipad/memory/`
4. **Update index:** Edit `memory/MEMORY.md` to point to new files

**Example:** If you find a second bug:
```bash
# Create new memory file
C:\Users\ivand\.claude\projects\Q--REPO-digipad\memory\bug_camera_lag.md

# Add to index
# memory/MEMORY.md: - [Camera Lag Bug](bug_camera_lag.md) — ...
```

Agents will automatically see it next session.
