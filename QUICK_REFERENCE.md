## 🎯 Current Issue (Critical)

**Pantoscopic Angle Calculation is BROKEN**

**File:** `lib/screens/native_impl/native_split_screen.dart`, lines 67-68

**Problem:** Measures horizontal roll instead of vertical pitch

**Current (Wrong):**
```dart
final newPitch = atan2(-x, sqrt(y * y + z * z)) * (180 / pi);
```

**Should Be:**
```dart
final newPitch = atan2(-y, sqrt(x * x + z * z)) * (180 / pi);
```

**Why:** Pantoscopic angle needs forward-backward (Y) axis, not left-right (X) axis.

## 🔧 Key Technologies

| What | Tech | Why |
|------|------|-----|
| **State** | BLoC + Cubit | Clean, testable, scalable |
| **Camera** | Android/iOS native view | Fast, full control |
| **Detection** | TFLite (on-device ML) | Offline, privacy-preserving |
| **Orientation** | sensors_plus accelerometer | Device tilt measurement |
| **Localization** | ARB format | Multi-language support |
| **Storage** | Sembast + SharedPreferences | Local persistence |
| **Backend** | Firebase (optional) | Cloud sync, analytics |

## 📊 Data Flow

```
Camera Stream / Gallery Image
  ↓
sensors_plus.accelerometerEvents (real-time orientation)
  ↓
Calculate pantoscopic angle ← **BUG IS HERE** (wrong formula)
  ↓
Show angle overlay (expect 0-15° range)
  ↓
User taps to capture
  ↓
Native code: TFLite detection of 4 circles + pupil centers
  ↓
If successful → OpticalEditorScreen (refine measurements)
If failed → Show error, ask to retake
```

## 🐛 Debugging the Angle

### Quick Check
1. Enter camera screen
2. Look at angle overlay (top-right)
3. Tilt device naturally (like reading)
4. Expected: Should show **+10° to +15°**
5. Currently: Shows wrong value (likely outside this range)

### How to Verify Fix
**Before Fix:**
- Device vertical = random value
- Device tilted forward = doesn't increase (or decreases)
- Overlay green/red borders don't match device tilt

**After Fix:**
- Device vertical = ~0°
- Device tilted forward = increases to +15°
- Overlay border changes smoothly, matches physical tilt

## 🎮 Common Tasks

### Run the app
```bash
flutter run
```

### Build for Android
```bash
flutter build apk --release
```

### Build for iOS
```bash
flutter build ios --release
```

### Fix the angle bug
1. Open `lib/screens/native_impl/native_split_screen.dart`
2. Find lines 67-68
3. Change `atan2(-x, ...)` to `atan2(-y, ...)`
4. Test on real device in various tilts
5. Commit: "fix: correct pantoscopic angle calculation (use Y-axis instead of X)"

### Add new localization string
1. Open `lib/l10n/arb/app_en.arb` (English)
2. Add: `"newStringKey": "English text"`
3. Open `lib/l10n/arb/app_es.arb` (Spanish, if supported)
4. Add same key + translation
5. Use: `context.l10n.newStringKey`

### Access camera in code
Already done in `native_split_screen.dart` — it's the reference for camera integration

| `native_split_screen.dart` | 1033 | **Camera capture + angle measurement** |
| `optical_editor_screen.dart` | 1300+ | Post-capture UI, measurement refinement |
| `optical_logic_controller.dart` | ~350 | Optical geometry calculations |
| `optical_painter.dart` | ~250 | Canvas rendering of detected points |
| `main.dart` | 95 | App setup, orientation lock, Firebase |

## ⚠️ Common Pitfalls

1. **Accelerometer axes are confusing** — Always verify on device
2. **Formula sign errors** — atan2 is sensitive to argument order
3. **Native channel latency** — Camera methods are async
4. **Permission checks** — Always check before camera/gallery access
5. **Flutter hot reload** — May not reload MethodChannel handlers; do full restart

## 🧪 Testing Checklist

- [ ] Can open camera without crashing
- [ ] Angle displays in overlay
- [ ] Angle changes when device tilted
- [ ] Angle is 0° when device vertical
- [ ] Angle is +15° when tilted forward (reading posture)
- [ ] Can capture photo
- [ ] Photo navigates to OpticalEditorScreen
- [ ] Angle is passed to editor correctly

## 💡 Tips

- **Stuck?** Check `CLAUDE.md` for full context
- **Debugging angle?** Enable print statements in accelerometer listener
- **Need sensors data?** `sensors_plus` has gyro too, not just accelerometer
- **Camera fails on iOS?** Check `ios/Runner/Info.plist` for camera permission description
- **MethodChannel not responding?** Verify native code is actually built
